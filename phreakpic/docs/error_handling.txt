Error Handling. (not yet fully implemented)

Design:
There error hanling consits of one global container in which every error (or warning) message is stored.

Interface:
All error in the container will be displayed in a list in n new browser window.
The user can give a comment what he was doing when before the error occurse

Fatal Errors:
If a fatal error occurs the script will be stoped right away and the message will be display in the same browser window.

Coding:
The global container is an array.
Every error is an object.
At the end of each page the array is parsed and if needed the error pages created.
