Installation and Configuration

Install & Configure PHPBB 2 (I will assume in this docu that you install it to /phpbb2)

Install Smarty (I will assume in this docu that you install it to /smarty)

Extract all files under your webbrowsers document root (I will assume in this docu that you use /phreakpic)

Database Setup
Create the tables in your db like described in /phreakpic/docs/db.sql
This is an PhpMyAdmin dump of the db structure. So you can just execute the whole file in your db.
All tables will have the prefix photo_ if you want to change this you have to edit the file.


Configure PhreakPic
Open /phreakpic/config.inc.php and edit the following options.
The First 4 defines are pathes to required locations (Smarty,phpbb2,phreakpic,home)
Just follow the comments above them.
Afterward their is the config array this holds all settings for phreakpic.
You can mostly leave the defaults. The comments should help you if you want to change something.
Only one setting is very important: The 'root_categorie'. We will come to this later.

Now create a content/cat and usergroups (you must be logged into phpBB2 with an user that has admin rights)
Goto /phreakpic/admin/user_in_groups.php
On top of the page you can create usergroups. Enter a name and description and press the submit button.
Now add your user the group.
The table has 4 columns. In the first you select the usergroup where you want to change something. 
Here you can also delete groups.
The second show the users that are not in that group.
In the third there are buttons to add or remove the selected user from the group
And in the last are the users which are in this group

Now create catgroups
Goto /phreakpic/admin/auths.php
Create cat group the same way you created the usergroup.
On top of the page you have a table with 3 columns.
The first show all usergroups
The second show the rights which the selected usergroup has in the selected catgroup, which is in the last column.
Your created cat and usergroup should already be selected. Now click on create auth in the middle column.
Now you can select what the selected usergroup is allowed to do in the selected catgroup. 
For now maybe you just select everything (not so important because admin are always allowed to do everything)
When finished click on submit below the table.

And at last the contentgroups
Goto /phreakpic/admin/auths.php?type=content
This works exactly as the catgroups.

Now the bit tricky part: Create the root categorie.
Execute the following line in your db. Change table_prefix if you have changed it before (in uor case it is photo_).
INSERT INTO photo_cats (id, name, current_rating, parent_id, catgroup_id, is_serie, content_amount, description) 
		VALUES (0, 'Root Cat', 0,            0,          0,          '0',       0,         'Description');

This creates the root categorie important is, that id and parent_id are the same. 
For catgroup_id you should enter the id of you previously created catgroup. (Look in the db to find out)
Now you have to change the 'root_categorie' setting in /phreakpic/config.inc.php. Set it to the id of the root categorie, 
if you use the line above it would be 0.


Finished ;) 
Read the usermanual (/phreakpic/docs/userdoc.txt) to see how to create new cats and add content.
